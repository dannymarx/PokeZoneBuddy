# Shortcuts and Integrations

Extend PokeZoneBuddy beyond the app with system integrations that save time and keep your plans connected.

## macOS Shortcuts
- Use the share button inside the Timeline Planner to send city schedules directly to macOS Shortcuts flows.
- Trigger calendar exports, clipboard actions, or automation that posts to Discord or Slack.
- Combine the exported `.pzb` file with a Shortcut to archive plans automatically.

## Calendar Export
- From an event detail or the Timeline Planner, choose **Add to Calendar** (macOS only).
- Select the cities you want to include. The app creates calendar entries with correct start and end times based on each city’s local timezone.
- Move or edit the events using the Calendar app after export if you need further customisation.

## Share Sheet
- Every export route uses the native share sheet so you can AirDrop, save to Files, or send via Messages instantly.
- Timeline images render at high resolution (1200×800) for crisp sharing in guides or social media.

## File Management
- Timeline `.pzb` bundles and city exports live in the system temporary directory until you share or save them. Make sure to store important files in a safe location if you plan to reuse them.
