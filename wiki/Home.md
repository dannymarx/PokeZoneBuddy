# PokeZoneBuddy Wiki

Welcome to the public guide for PokeZoneBuddy — your Swiss army knife for keeping Pokémon GO events, cities, and timelines organised across macOS and iOS. This wiki highlights what the app can do, how to get started fast, and where to dive deeper.

## What You Can Do
- Track live and upcoming events with countdowns, filters, and rich detail cards.
- Build multi-city timelines that convert event windows into any timezone and share them as images or portable plan files.
- Save favourite cities and custom raid spots so your travel-ready intel is always synced.
- Schedule reminders with flexible lead times and optional calendar exports on macOS.
- Back up or restore your entire city and spot library, and manage cached data when storage gets tight.
