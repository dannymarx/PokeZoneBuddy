# Cities and Spots

Build a personal travel library by saving favourite cities and custom points of interest. PokeZoneBuddy keeps everything synchronised with rich metadata, so your raid routes and meetup points are always close at hand.

## Managing Favourite Cities
- **Add Cities:** Tap the add button in the Cities tab and type a city name. Suggestions come from Apple Maps search; pick the best match to capture the correct timezone.
- **Automatic Timezones:** The app resolves the city’s timezone identifier and prevents duplicates, so every entry stays unique.
- **Sorting and Search:** Sort by name, country, continent, timezone, date added, or number of spots. Use the search field for quick filtering.
- **Cleanup:** Removing a city automatically deletes its associated spots to keep the database tidy.

## Working with Spots
- **City View:** Each city card opens a list of saved spots (gyms, PokéStops, meetup points, or anything you like).
- **Add or Edit:** Supply a name, optional notes, and coordinates. The coordinate parser helps catch typos and enforces a 10 m duplicate threshold per city.
- **Favourites:** Flag important spots to pin them to the top of the list.
- **Share Coordinates:** Copy formatted coordinates to share in chats or raid guides.

## Global Spot Search
- Use the unified search view to look across all saved spots and events at the same time.
- Selecting a spot jumps straight to its details inside the relevant city.

## Export and Import
- Export your entire city and spot collection as JSON, then re-import it on another device or share it with friends. Learn how in [Data Management](./Data-Management).
