## Quick Tips
- **Pin your home base:** Add your daily city first so timelines always include the timezone you care about.
- **Use templates for repeat events:** Community Days, Raid Hours, and Spotlight Hours benefit from prebuilt city lists.
- **Queue multiple reminders:** Mix short and long lead times (e.g., 1 hour and 15 minutes) to stay on track without constantly checking the app.
- **Spot notes matter:** Include landmarks or meeting instructions in spot notes so friends instantly know where to go.
- **Export before big trips:** Save your timelines and city lists before traveling so you can import them on a borrowed device if needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Does PokeZoneBuddy require an internet connection?**  
It fetches events online, but cached data, saved cities, spots, and timelines remain fully usable offline.

**Can I share timelines with players who don’t have the app?**  
Yes. Export the timeline as an image for instant sharing, or send the `.pzb` file so another PokeZoneBuddy user can import it.

**What happens if I delete a city?**  
Associated spots are removed automatically. Export your cities first if you think you may need them later.

**Why don’t I see notifications after enabling them?**  
Confirm that reminders are toggled on for the event, your selected offsets are active, and system notifications are allowed. Run a test alert from Settings if you are unsure.

**How do I change the app language?**  
The app currently ships with English and German localisation. Switch your device language to see the matching strings.
