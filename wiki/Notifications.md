# Notifications

Never miss a raid hour or Community Day again. PokeZoneBuddy’s reminder system keeps you updated with flexible lead times, timezone-aware scheduling, and optional calendar exports.

## Enabling Notifications
- On first launch, accept the system prompt to allow notifications. If you declined, visit **System Settings → Notifications → PokeZoneBuddy** (macOS) or **Settings → Notifications → PokeZoneBuddy** (iOS) to enable alerts later.
- Use the in-app **Notification Settings** screen to check your current permission status and run a test notification.

## Scheduling Reminders
- Open an event detail and toggle one or more reminder offsets (15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 1 day).
- macOS users can choose which city’s local timezone controls the reminder, perfect for travel planning.
- Reminders follow your favourites: starring an event restores the last offsets you used the next time it appears.
- Disable reminders for an event at any time; the app cleans up pending notifications automatically.

## Calendar Export (macOS)
- From the Timeline Planner or event detail view, add single-city or multi-city timelines directly to Calendar.
- The app requests EventKit permission the first time you export. After approval, calendar entries land in your default calendar with the correct timezone.

## Managing Notifications
- Visit Settings → Notifications to:
  - Review the number of scheduled reminders.
  - Trigger a test notification to confirm delivery.
  - Jump straight to system settings if permissions change.
- Background refresh routinely clears expired reminders and temporary notification images.
