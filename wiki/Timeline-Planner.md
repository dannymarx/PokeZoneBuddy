# Timeline Planner

The Timeline Planner helps you play Pokémon GO events across multiple cities without manual timezone math. Create reusable plans, export them for friends, and even send them to your macOS calendar.

## Build Your First Timeline
1. Open an event from the Events hub.
2. Tap **Plan Timeline** to enter the planner.
3. Add cities from your favourites list. The planner converts each city’s local window into your current timezone so you can see overlaps and gaps.
4. Review the sequential timeline chart to understand when to start and stop in each city.

## Save and Reuse Plans
- **Save Plan:** Give the plan a name (e.g., “Community Day Asia Sweep”) and store it for the specific event.
- **Load Plans:** Saved plans appear in the planner’s menu so you can switch between strategies instantly.
- **Templates:** Create templates tied to an event type (Community Day, Raid Hour, etc.). Templates pre-fill cities for every new event of that type.
- **Defaults:** Mark a template as the default for an event type so new plans start with your go-to city list.

## Share Your Work
- **Export Image:** Capture the timeline as a high-resolution PNG ready for Discord, social media, or guides.
- **Export Plan (`.pzb`):** Share a portable JSON bundle that teammates can import. Plans include city ordering and metadata for the event.
- **Import Plans:** Use the Settings → Timeline Management card to import `.pzb` files you receive (see [Data Management](./Data-Management)).

## Calendar Integration (macOS)
- macOS users can add single-city or multi-city plans directly to Calendar. Choose the cities you want, then select **Add to Calendar**.
- The app handles timezone conversion and prompts for EventKit permission the first time you export.

## Best Practices
- Keep city lists short and purposeful so the timeline remains easy to scan.
- Use templates for recurring event types so you spend less time rebuilding plans.
- Re-export plans after making edits to ensure teammates get the latest version.
