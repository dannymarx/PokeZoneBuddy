# Settings and Utilities

The Settings area keeps PokeZoneBuddy organised, performant, and personalised. Use it to manage themes, cache usage, timeline assets, and quick access tools.

## Layout Overview
- **Theme Controls:** Switch between system, light, and dark appearances. The app remembers your choice per device.
- **Stats at a Glance:** See how many events, cities, spots, favourites, plans, and templates are stored locally.
- **Navigation Cards:** Jump to Timeline Plans, Templates, Import/Export tools, Notifications, and Legal notes.

## Timeline Management
- **Plans List:** Rename, delete, or export saved plans tied to specific events.
- **Templates View:** Create reusable city sets per event type and manage default templates.
- **Import Plans:** Use the dedicated Timeline Import button to pull `.pzb` files shared by friends or teammates.

## Cache and Data Tools
- **Cache Overview:** Review cached event counts and image storage usage.
- **Cleanup Actions:** Clear image cache or prune events older than 30 days with one tap when you need to reclaim space.
- **Offline Awareness:** Background refresh and manual cleanup routines keep storage lean without losing critical data.

## Notifications Panel
- Monitor notification permission status.
- Run test alerts, see how many reminders are queued, or open system settings directly if you need to change permissions.

## Legal and About
- Access attribution, fair use guidelines, and licensing information from the Legal section.
